      <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>
      <div class="details">
        Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern.
        Also known as "regex" or "regexp", they help programmers match, search,
        and replace text. Regular expressions can appear cryptic( * kriptik
        means - गुप्त) because a few characters have special meaning. The goal
        is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you
        want, but only what you want. This section will cover the characters, a
        few shortcuts, and the common uses for writing regular expressions.
